When your manager does your work [for you](http://taras.glek.net/blog/2013/02/22/snappy-number-51-smoothing-tab-animations/), it means something has gone wrong along the way. So here is me fixing it - finally I've setup a blog. You can read a bit about me [here](/about).

Welcome aboard.

Since I joined the performance team at Mozilla not long ago, I've been working on animation smoothness, starting with tab animation, but touching related subjects as well.

In this space, I hope to provide interesting progress notes on this and related subjects.

Stay tuned.
